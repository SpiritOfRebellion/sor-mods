It's a training project for VCMI, which will probably evolve into a modpack.

# 1. Pit lord's summoning extended
The mod's goal is to add new summon abilities 'riseImps' and 'riseGogs' to the Pit Lord, based on its native ability to rise demons from corpses (currently crashes after a click on the icons).
